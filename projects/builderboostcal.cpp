/*
Here are the key changes and improvements:

Removed unnecessary casting: Casting (double)time to double is redundant since time is already a double.

Simplified getline usage: Removed >> ws from getline(cin >> ws, name); and getline(cin >> ws, building); as it is unnecessary and can cause issues. getline(cin, name); and getline(cin, building); are sufficient.

Corrected the calculation: Adjusted the logic to account for the one-hour boost correctly, considering that one hour at 10x speed completes

  of the job, which is 0.4 days' worth of work in one hour, leaving 9.6 hours of normal work to be subtracted from the total.

Added clarity: Improved prompt messages and added punctuation for better readability.
